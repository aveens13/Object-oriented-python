#abstraction is basically the process of problem solving in python....
in object oriented programming abstraction is nothing but a layer of program for
any application
While performing a real problem in python we might need a bunch of classes.. these
class are different layers of abstraction.. each class has different attributes which
are further a smaller layer of abstraction.. similarly a single application from a bunch of class
and module is another abstraction and bunch of applications ina  single project
(each applications are abstracts of a project)

"""
Encapsulation is the process of hiding the real implementation of an 
application from the user and emphasizing only on usage of it. 

Encapsulation in Python is the process of wrapping up variables and 
methods into a single entity.In programming, a class is an example that 
wraps all the variables and methods defined inside it.

In the real world, consider your college as an example. Each and every 
department's student records are restricted only within the respective department.
CSE department faculty cannot access the ECE department student record and so on. 
Here, the department acts as the class and student records act like variables 
and methods.

Before understanding its working, let us look at the advantages of using Encapsulation in programs.
